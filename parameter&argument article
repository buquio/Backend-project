Introduction
In this article, I'll be discussing the differences between these two(2) keywords: Arguments and Parameters in Programming. These are terms that are often misunderstood and sometimes interchanged when talking about functions.

Definitions
What are Parameters?
Parameters in simple terms are placeholders for what are needed in the future in a function.

What are Arguments?
Arguments are values used as input to a function.

Code Snippets
function addNumbers(x, y) {
   return x + y;
};

COPY
addNumbers(2, 3);

Code Explanation
In the first code snippet, we created a function to add numbers.
We gave it parameters of x and y.
The 'x' and 'y' acts as placeholder for any value we plan on inserting into the function in the future when it's being called.
In the second code snippet, we called the function already created in code snippet 1, the passed some values to it.
The values "2" and "3" replaced the placeholders "x" and "y".
Those values here are referred to as Arguments.
Conclusion
Parameters are just spaces we reserve for use in future while Arguments are items or values we insert into those spaces when the function or code is needed in future.
